<h2>Color Palette</h2>

<p>
    A consistent application of a color palette builds recognition and strengthens our brand. Our core color, Aubergine, is a rich,
dark purple which is unique among financial services brands, distinguishing our firm, and reinforcing our innovative spirit.
</p>
<p>
    Primary colors are used most prominently in communications. Secondary colors are used as accent colors and for presenting data,
but must not overwhelm the primary colors. Silver, our specialty color, should only be used as a real metallic in printed communications.
Therefore, silver should never be printed in CMYK or used in digital applications. The use of black is limited to text applications,
background gray is limited to background applications, and red is limited to presenting negative points in charts, graphs, or tables.
White is an integral part of our visual identity and is used as a natural background color for most applications
